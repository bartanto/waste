# Waste - a garbage scraper for garbage price data

This is parses some price data for garbage from here: https://www.letsrecycle.com/prices/waste-paper/uk-domestic-mill-prices/

The code is pretty crap, and improvements could definitely be made by using something like beautiful soup

## To run the code:

- make sure you have python3 installed on your system
- run `python3 waste.py`

**data.csv** is also provided for prices up to 2021
